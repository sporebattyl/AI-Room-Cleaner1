# Logging and Monitoring Strategy

## 1. Structured Logging

### Backend (Python)

*   **Library:** `loguru`
*   **Format:** JSON
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Replace the standard logging library with `loguru`.
    *   Configure a JSON formatter to ensure all log entries are structured.
    *   Include key information in every log entry, such as a timestamp, log level, message, and context-specific data (e.g., request ID, user ID).

### Frontend (JavaScript)

*   **Library:** `pino`
*   **Format:** JSON
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Integrate `pino` into the frontend application.
    *   Create a logging service that can be used across all modules.
    *   Log key user interactions, API requests/responses, and errors.

## 2. Centralized Logging

*   **Proposed Solution:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
*   **Reasoning:** The ELK Stack is a powerful, open-source solution that provides a scalable platform for log aggregation, storage, and analysis.
*   **Alternatives:**
    *   **Grafana Loki:** A simpler, more cost-effective solution that integrates well with Grafana.
    *   **Cloud-based services:** Datadog, Logz.io, or similar services that offer managed logging solutions.

## 3. Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Proposed Solution:** Prometheus and Grafana
*   **Reasoning:** Prometheus is a leading open-source monitoring solution, and Grafana is a powerful tool for creating dashboards and setting up alerts.
*   **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
    *   **Application Health:** API error rates, response times, and uptime.
    *   **Performance:** CPU and memory utilization, database query performance, and image processing times.
    *   **Security:** Failed login attempts, suspicious API requests, and other security-related events.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   Configure alerts in Grafana to notify the team of critical issues via email, Slack, or other channels.
    *   Set up alerts for key metrics, such as high error rates, slow response times, and resource exhaustion.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Phase 1: Structured Logging**
    *   Integrate `loguru` into the backend and `pino` into the frontend.
    *   Update the codebase to use the new logging libraries.
    *   Ensure that all logs are in a structured JSON format.

2.  **Phase 2: Centralized Logging**
    *   Set up an ELK Stack instance.
    *   Configure Logstash to collect logs from both the backend and frontend.
    *   Create Kibana dashboards to visualize and analyze the logs.

3.  **Phase 3: Monitoring and Alerting**
    *   Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from the backend.
    *   Create Grafana dashboards to visualize key application metrics.
    *   Configure alerts in Grafana to notify the team of critical issues.
