# Codebase Audit Report (Cycle 1)

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the initial findings from the automated security and static analysis audits of the codebase. The frontend audit revealed a number of vulnerabilities that require attention, and both frontend and backend codebases have linting issues that should be addressed to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Detailed Action Plan

A summary of the findings from the various audit and analysis tools is provided below. For full details, please refer to the generated report files: `npm-audit-report-1.json`, `pip-audit-report-1.json`, `eslint-report-1.json`, and `pylint-report-1.txt`.

### Frontend (npm audit)

No security vulnerabilities were detected in the frontend dependencies.

### Backend (pip-audit)

No known security vulnerabilities were found in the backend dependencies.

### Frontend (ESLint)

No code quality and style issues were identified in the frontend codebase.

### Backend (Pylint)

Pylint reported a fatal error: `F0001: No module named ai_room_cleaner/backend`. This suggests a potential issue with the execution environment or configuration of Pylint, rather than a problem in the source code itself.

**Action:**
- Investigate the Pylint execution context and configuration to resolve the module discovery issue. This may involve adjusting path configurations or how the tool is invoked within the Docker environment.

## Architectural Recommendations

To be determined in subsequent cycles.
