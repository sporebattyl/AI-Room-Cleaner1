# Codebase Audit Report (Cycle 10)

## Executive Summary

This report validates the critical fixes applied to the `DELETE /history` endpoint during Cycle 9. The audit confirms that the previously identified issues—a CORS misconfiguration on the backend and a missing API key on the frontend—have been successfully remediated. The "clear history" functionality is now fully operational.

The codebase has significantly improved since the last cycle. However, this audit has revealed a critical gap in the testing suite: there is **no automated test coverage** for the `GET /history` and `DELETE /history` endpoints. While the feature works as expected based on manual inspection, the lack of tests poses a regression risk for future development cycles.

**Overall Health Score:**
- **Grade:** A
- **Score:** 95/100
- **Justification:** The core functionality has been successfully repaired, and the codebase is stable and functional. The score is marked down from a perfect A+ solely due to the absence of automated tests for the history feature, which is a crucial part of maintaining long-term code quality and preventing future bugs.
- **Cycle Goal:** Achieve an "A+" score by implementing comprehensive test coverage for the history endpoints.

## Detailed Action Plan

| Priority | File Path | Line(s) | Description | Suggested Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | `ai_room_cleaner/backend/tests/test_router.py` | N/A | **Missing Test Coverage:** The test suite does not include any tests for the `GET /history` or `DELETE /history` endpoints. | Add new test cases to `test_router.py` to cover the following scenarios: <br> 1. Test that `GET /history` returns an empty list initially. <br> 2. Test that `DELETE /history` works correctly with a valid API key. <br> 3. Test that `DELETE /history` returns a 401 error with an invalid or missing API key. <br> 4. Test the full lifecycle: add an item, get history, delete history, get history again. |

## Architectural & Future-Proofing Recommendations

- **Enforce Test Coverage:** The discovery of untested code highlights the need for a more rigorous development process. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests and checks for a minimum level of test coverage before allowing code to be merged would prevent such gaps in the future.
- **Frontend Testing:** The current test suite focuses exclusively on the backend. Expanding automated testing to include frontend components (e.g., using Jest and Testing Library) would further improve application reliability and reduce the risk of UI-related bugs.
- **Persistent Storage:** The in-memory history service is suitable for development but not for production. Planning for a transition to a persistent database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) would be a logical next step for the application's evolution.
