## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the findings from the second cycle of the codebase audit. The audit found no security vulnerabilities in either the frontend or backend dependencies. The frontend code passed the ESLint static analysis with no errors or warnings. The backend code, however, has one minor issue reported by Pylint regarding the naming convention of the `ai_room_cleaner/backend` module.

## Detailed Action Plan

### Dependency Security Audit

*   **NPM Audit (frontend):** No vulnerabilities found. No action required.
*   **PIP Audit (backend):** No vulnerabilities found. No action required.

### Static Code Analysis

*   **ESLint (frontend):** No errors or warnings. No action required.
*   **Pylint (backend):**
    *   **Issue:** `ai_room_cleaner/backend/__init__.py:1:0: C0103: Module name "ai_room_cleaner/backend" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)`
    *   **Action:** The module naming convention warning is due to the directory structure and is a low-priority issue. To resolve the warning without a major refactor, a `pylint: disable=invalid-name` comment will be added to the top of the `ai_room_cleaner/backend/__init__.py` file.
