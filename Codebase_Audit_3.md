## Executive Summary

This report details a confirmation audit of the codebase to ensure continued stability and security.

The dependency security audits for both the frontend and backend services completed successfully, revealing no new vulnerabilities. The codebase remains at an "A+" level from a dependency security perspective.

However, the static code analysis for both the frontend (`eslint`) and backend (`pylint`) could not be completed due to persistent issues with the tooling inside the Docker containers.

## Detailed Action Plan

No new issues found in the dependency audits.

Static code analysis was not completed and will need to be addressed separately.

## Architectural Recommendations

No new architectural recommendations at this time.
