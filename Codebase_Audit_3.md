# Codebase Audit Report (Cycle 3)

## Executive Summary

The third cycle of the codebase audit reveals a clean bill of health across the board. All automated checks, including `npm audit`, `pip audit`, `ESLint`, and `Pylint`, have passed without identifying any new vulnerabilities, code quality issues, or style violations. This indicates that the recent refactoring and dependency updates have successfully addressed previously identified problems and have maintained a high standard of code quality.
