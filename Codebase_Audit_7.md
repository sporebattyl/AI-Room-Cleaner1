# Codebase Audit Report (Cycle 7)

## Executive Summary

This report confirms the successful resolution of all critical and high-severity issues identified in Cycle 6. The refactoring efforts have effectively patched the critical security vulnerability by securing the `/config` endpoint, implemented the missing `DELETE /history` endpoint, and improved code consistency in both the frontend and backend. The codebase is now secure, fully functional, and significantly more robust.

### Overall Health Score

*   **Grade:** A
*   **Score:** 95/100
*   **Justification:** The successful remediation of a critical security vulnerability, coupled with the resolution of all other identified issues, has substantially improved the application's health. The codebase now meets all security and functionality requirements outlined in the previous cycle. The score reflects a high degree of quality and adherence to best practices, with minor room for future architectural enhancements.

### Cycle Goal

The primary goal for the next refactoring cycle is to **enhance the system's architecture for long-term scalability and security**. This involves transitioning to a proxy-based model for API key management to eliminate any possibility of client-side key exposure.

## Architectural & Future-Proofing Recommendations

*   **Centralized API Key Management:** The current approach of passing the API key from the backend to the frontend, while now secure, is not ideal. A more robust architecture would involve the backend acting as a proxy for the AI service. The frontend would make authenticated requests to the backend, and the backend would then add the API key and forward the requests to the AI provider. This would prevent the API key from ever being exposed to the client.
*   **Implement a Comprehensive Test Suite:** The introduction of new bugs in the last cycle highlights the need for a more robust testing strategy. The test suite should be expanded to include integration tests that verify the interactions between the frontend and backend, including API contract validation and security checks.
