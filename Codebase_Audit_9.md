# Codebase Audit Report (Cycle 9)

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the AI Room Cleaner codebase following the implementation of the `DELETE /history` endpoint. The audit reveals that while the backend endpoint was created, critical integration and configuration issues have been introduced, causing the feature to be non-functional. The overall quality of the codebase has regressed as a result.

The primary issues are a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy on the backend that blocks `DELETE` requests, and a missing API key in the frontend's request to the new endpoint. These errors render the "clear history" functionality completely inoperable.

**Overall Health Score:**
- **Grade:** B-
- **Score:** 78/100
- **Justification:** The introduction of a non-functional feature due to two critical, yet easily avoidable, errors represents a significant regression in code quality and testing rigor. The core architecture remains solid, but the failure to properly implement and test a new feature prevents a higher score.
- **Cycle Goal:** Remediate the identified bugs to make the `DELETE /history` feature fully functional and restore the codebase to its previous high-quality state.

## Detailed Action Plan

| Priority | File Path | Line(s) | Description | Suggested Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | `ai_room_cleaner/backend/main.py` | 114 | **CORS Misconfiguration:** The `CORSMiddleware` does not permit the `DELETE` HTTP method, blocking the frontend's request. | Add `"DELETE"` to the `allow_methods` list in the `CORSMiddleware` configuration. |
| High | `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/modules/api.js` | 108 | **Missing API Key:** The `clearHistory` function does not include the `X-API-KEY` header in its request, causing an authentication failure. | Modify the `clearHistory` function to fetch the API key using `getConfig()` and include it in the `X-API-KEY` header of the request, similar to the `analyzeRoom` function. |

## Architectural & Future-Proofing Recommendations

- **Real-time Updates with WebSockets:** For a more dynamic user experience, consider implementing WebSockets to provide real-time updates to the frontend. This would allow the server to push updates to the client without requiring the client to poll for changes.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** To automate the testing and deployment process, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline. This would ensure that all code is automatically tested before being deployed, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production.
- **Configuration Management:** As the application grows, consider using a more robust configuration management solution, such as a dedicated configuration server or a library like `pydantic-settings`. This would make it easier to manage configuration across different environments.
