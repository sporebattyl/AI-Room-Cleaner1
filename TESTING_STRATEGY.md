# AI Room Cleaner: Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the formal testing strategy for the AI Room Cleaner application. The goal is to ensure the reliability, security, and quality of the application by implementing a comprehensive testing approach for both the backend and frontend. This strategy is based on the findings and recommendations from the `Codebase_Audit_Enhancement_Plan.md`.

## 2. Backend Testing

The Python backend will be tested using a multi-layered approach to ensure all components function correctly.

### 2.1. Tools and Frameworks

*   **Test Runner:** `pytest`
*   **Code Coverage:** `pytest-cov`
*   **API Testing:** `httpx` (for making async requests to the API)

### 2.2. Testing Layers

#### 2.2.1. Unit Tests
*   **Objective:** To test individual functions and classes in isolation.
*   **Scope:** Focus on the business logic within services (e.g., `ai_service.py`), utility functions, and data models.
*   **Implementation:** Tests will be located in the `ai_room_cleaner/backend/tests/` directory and will mock external dependencies like AI providers and databases.

#### 2.2.2. Integration Tests
*   **Objective:** To test the interaction between different backend components.
*   **Scope:** Verify that the API layer correctly communicates with the service layer and that data flows correctly between them.
*   **Implementation:** These tests will also reside in the `ai_room_cleaner/backend/tests/` directory but will involve fewer mocks, focusing on the integration points.

#### 2.2.3. API Endpoint Tests
*   **Objective:** To test the full request-response cycle of the API endpoints.
*   **Scope:** Test all API endpoints for correct status codes, response payloads, and error handling. This includes testing for security aspects like input validation and authentication.
*   **Implementation:** Use `httpx` to send requests to a running instance of the application with a test configuration.

## 3. Frontend Testing

The JavaScript frontend will be tested to ensure a reliable and smooth user experience.

### 3.1. Tools and Frameworks

*   **Component/Unit Testing:** `Vitest`
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** `Playwright`
*   **Code Coverage:** `vitest`'s built-in coverage reporting.

### 3.2. Testing Layers

#### 3.2.1. Component Tests
*   **Objective:** To test individual UI components in isolation.
*   **Scope:** Verify that components render correctly, manage their state, and handle user interactions as expected.
*   **Implementation:** Tests will be co-located with the component files (e.g., `component.test.js`).

#### 3.2.2. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
*   **Objective:** To test complete user flows from the user's perspective.
*   **Scope:** Simulate user interactions like uploading an image, receiving the analysis, and interacting with the UI.
*   **Implementation:** E2E tests will be written using `Playwright` and will run against a fully running application (both frontend and backend).

## 4. Test Coverage

*   **Backend:** A target code coverage of **80%** will be enforced. This will be measured using `pytest-cov`.
*   **Frontend:** A target code coverage of **70%** will be enforced for component tests. This will be measured using `vitest`.

## 5. Test Execution

Tests will be executed at different stages of the development lifecycle to provide fast feedback.

### 5.1. Pre-Commit Hooks

*   A pre-commit hook (using a tool like `pre-commit`) will be configured to run linters and a subset of fast-running unit tests before allowing a commit. This ensures that code quality standards are met before code is even pushed.

### 5.2. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

*   A CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) will be set up to run the full test suite (unit, integration, API, and E2E) on every push to the main branch and on every pull request.
*   The CI pipeline will also be responsible for building the application and running the code coverage reports. A build will only be considered successful if all tests pass and the coverage targets are met.

### 5.3. Testing Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the testing workflow:
