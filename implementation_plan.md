# Implementation Plan for AI Room Cleaner Frontend

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement the fixes and improvements suggested in `Claudefixes/frontendfixes.md`. The changes are prioritized to address the most critical issues first.

---

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities

**Objective:** Prevent malicious script injection by sanitizing user-generated content before rendering it in the DOM.

**File to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/modules/ui.js`

**Changes:**

*   **In `createMessItem` function:** Instead of returning an HTML string, create DOM elements directly and set their `textContent`.
*   **In `showError` function:** Similarly, use `textContent` to display error messages instead of `innerHTML`.

**Implementation Details:**

The `createMessItem` and `showError` functions in `ui.js` should be modified to avoid using `innerHTML` with unprocessed data.

*   The `createMessItem` function should be changed to create and return a DOM element.
*   The logic that calls `createMessItem` should be updated to append these elements to a `DocumentFragment` before adding them to the DOM to improve performance.
*   The `showError` function should set the `textContent` of the error element.

This approach mitigates XSS risks by ensuring that any data from the API is treated as text, not HTML.

### 2. Implement `localStorage` Fallback

**Objective:** Ensure the application functions correctly in environments where `localStorage` is unavailable (e.g., private browsing).

**File to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/app.js`

**Changes:**

*   Add a utility function `isStorageAvailable` to check for `localStorage` support.
*   Modify the `storage` object to use this check before accessing `localStorage`. If `localStorage` is not available, it should fall back to an in-memory object, allowing the application to function for the current session.

### 3. Add Basic Accessibility Features

**Objective:** Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support to make the application more accessible.

**File to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/index.html`

**Changes:**

*   Add `role` attributes to key elements (`button`, `list`, `listitem`) to define their purpose for assistive technologies.
*   Add `aria-label` to provide clear, descriptive labels for interactive elements like buttons and lists.
*   Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus states.

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement Debouncing for User Actions

**Objective:** Prevent excessive API calls from rapid, repeated user interactions, such as clicking the "Analyze Room" button multiple times.

**File to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/app.js`

**Changes:**

*   Add a generic `debounce` utility function.
*   Wrap the `analyzeRoom` event handler with the `debounce` function to delay execution until the user has stopped clicking for a specified interval (e.g., 500ms).

### 2. Standardize Error Handling

**Objective:** Create a consistent and user-friendly way to handle and display errors throughout the application.

**Files to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/modules/api.js`, `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/app.js`

**Changes:**

*   In `api.js`, create and throw specific error classes for different types of failures (e.g., `NetworkError`, `ServerError`).
*   In `app.js`, the `catch` block for API calls should inspect the error type and provide a specific, helpful message to the user via the `ui.showError` function.

### 3. Add More Loading States

**Objective:** Provide visual feedback to the user during all asynchronous operations, such as loading the analysis history.

**File to Modify:** `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/modules/ui.js`, `ai_room_cleaner/frontend/app.js`

**Changes:**

*   Create and export a function in `ui.js` to show a loading state for the history panel (e.g., a "Loading..." message or a skeleton loader).
*   Call this function in `app.js` before the history is fetched and hide it once the data has been rendered or an error occurs.
